Suppose you're given a list of numbers [a,b,c,...] that are the _pairwise sums_ of an ordered list of integers, in sequence.
From the list of pairwise sums, construct the original list of integers.

Ex1. [5,6,7] -> [2,3,4]
Ex2. [3,4,5,5,6,7] -> [1,2,3,4]

Assume the list of numbers is at least three items long.
